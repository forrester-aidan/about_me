        <p>
            I'm interested in full stack development as a career in my near future. 
            Throughout the course of my studies, I have perfected my understanding of coding languages and interpersonal abilities. 
            I am a capable and consistent problem-solver proficient at prioritizing and managing projects. 
            I am progressive-minded and in tune with new developments in my field.
            I have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong critical thinking talents.
        </p>
